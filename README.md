# ECE143_Project
This is the ECE 143 final project repo for team 8. 

## Data Scraping
Our team mannually scraped data from Glassdoor.com and save each job description into a numpy file. The dataset has 12285 non-reapeating job listings. 
 - First, get_job_ids.py pulls all the job ID's from Glassdoor and saves the ID numbers as a .txt file. 
 - Then, save_text.py loops through all the ID's and save each corresponding description into a separate numpy array of string. 
 
## Visualizations
### Pie Charts
Our team created three pie charts which are generated by overall_pie_charts.py and intern_pie_chart.py.
